What we did so that this godforsaken thing worked:

1. Found out that the folder was inside of another folder of the same name
2. Compute stick is connected to the wireless access point (the router thing) via a daisy chain of usb to ethernet adapters
3. The roborio is connected to the coding computer via usb. 
4. Ping the computstick to find the IPv4 address
